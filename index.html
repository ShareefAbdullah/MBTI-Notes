    <h1>MBTI Notes</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Most people are introduced to Carl Jung’s personality theory through MBTI websites. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a trademarked psychological assessment tool that was devised by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. Having studied Jung’s theory of psychological types, they believed that his ideas were worthy of a wider audience and sought to refine them for practical purposes. There have been many others who have tried to interpret Jung’s personality theory. This often causes confusion for newbies because they aren’t aware of Jung’s original theory, the many ways his theory has been interpreted, and the subsequent conflicts that have arisen between different researchers. While Jung did not live to see all of the later developments of his theory, the evidence suggests that he did NOT approve of using his personality theory to “stick labels on people”, which is unfortunately how it has been used at times.

            With the popularity of the MBTI system, many websites have popped up to assess people, sometimes for a fee and/or with the help of officially “certified” individuals. It is worth noting that the MBTI system is, in many ways, an oversimplification of Jung’s theory, which means that it is limited in what it can teach you about personality. The MBTI system doesn’t assess people using Jung’s cognitive functions because Myers and Briggs aimed to create shortcuts that would simplify the assessment process, which is how they came to create the four-letter personality codes that most people are familiar with. In my opinion, the MBTI system is very prone to assessment errors due to its lack of depth, as it ignores very important concepts in the name of practicality. Knowing the four letters of your type won’t bring you many benefits if you don’t know what to do with that information beyond feeling momentarily validated by a short type description. Since most people are familiar with the MBTI codes, this guide uses them as an entryway into explaining some basic concepts of Jung’s theory.</p>
